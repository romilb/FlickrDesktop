FlickDesk
=============

Flickr User Interface
One Terabyte of image storage Flickr provides sounds great until you upload thousands of image and they start vanishing in a vast heap of pictures. 
Rather that using simple tags based system, we've came with an entirely new approach of managing 1Tb your Flickr pictures. 
We let you organize them in a tree of folders like you do on your own PC. 
Just upload photos and FlickDesk will mantain the folder structures for you. 
The beta version of the application can be found at http://server-zerovelocity.rhcloud.com/FlickDesk
So enjoy the Flickr, with a new Feel!
